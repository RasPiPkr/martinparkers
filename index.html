			<p>Welcome to my website.<br><br>I've coded this website as part of my learning journey as I'm self taught. I mainly code in Python as I found it 
			to be an amazing starting language, great community and tons of libraries to work with. I used to do some programming when I was a teenager on my 
			old Commodore 64 sadly it was something I didn't continue with.<br><br>I took up coding again back in 2015 when I had heard about the Raspberry Pi and 
			I really enjoy the challenge of creating something that solves a problem and it's by doing these projects that has helped me to learn new skills.</p>
