						<p>I found the camera roughly 5 years ago at a car boot sale and I only picked it up as our daughter was studying photographic journalism. 
					I only got it in jest for our daughter and it didn’t cost me anything as it was in a box marked free stuff to a good home.</p>

						<p>I often see things and think can I fit a Raspberry Pi in it and or control it?<br><br>Yes it's ridiculous, crazy 
					and an accident waiting to happen but I think it's great and I love it as well as the mints.</p>

						<p>I've made a few little games using PyGame and I recently made a networked stock system server and client software, so I thought I could make 
						a controller that could control a game over my local network. I did plan on making a rifle but due to what materials I had at the time I'd 
						start with a hand gun.</p>

						<p>I do many projects with my Raspberry Pi's using the GPIO's and I thought it would be a good idea to make a way to make 
					notes against all the GPIO's, save it as a picture to put in the project folder or save the values in a CSV file so it can be updated 
					at a later date if the project changed in anyway.</p>

						<p>I came up with the idea for this project to help someone at work to trigger GPIO outputs wired to relays to switch on 
					Christmas Lights but it could be used for a timer of anything.</p>

						<p>My son is 6 and he's Lego mad, he has an amazing imagination and skill to build the creations. We was redecorating his bedroom and 
					I wallpapered a wall with some paper that looked like Lego bricks. He didn't know what I had planned, I was going to build him a giant piece of Lego 
					in his favourite colour yellow.</p>

						<p>I used to be a alarm engineer and with over 20 years experience it only seemed fit that I should do something as a security project. 
					I bought a brand new Texecom Reflex PIR as it's what my other PIR's are and they are a standard size.</p>

						<p>On my days off my wife occasionally does freelance work in Redditch for up to 5 hours, so I wanted to be able to use a Raspberry Pi 
						whilst away from home. I do have a windows 10 laptop and do take it with me but I prefer to code on my Raspberry Pi.</p>

						<a href="1.html"><h3>Website Online 2018</h3></a>
						<p>I wanted to create this website that I could improve as I learn more. I'm new to html and css but 
					I think my first effort is not bad. Over the past month I've been looking into html and css programming and 
					I will admit I changed my layout probably at least 10 times</p>
